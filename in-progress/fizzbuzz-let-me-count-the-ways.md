title: Fizzbuzz, Let Me Count the Ways
---

-   Did it many times myself
-   Learning something new every time, without fail
-   It's so simple, it gets out of the way
-   Refer to paper about the DSL
-   The many ways to abstract the code
-   Great for practicing TDD
-   Last week, arrived at a design variation for the first time
-   Compute `combinedSpecs` once, and then use `find` on every call
-   An abstraction over the long `if else`
