# GPT, Use your Tools!

> "The right tool makes the job easy, son." - My dad, Shlomo Avni

I had been joining my dad for the odd job around the house (not as much as I'd like anymore), and this phrase comes up again and again.

> "Use your tools!" - Emily Bache

These both stuck with me since I heard them.



I've been fortunate to work with Emily and to hear her tell this to us developers many a time. And she's right. Using tools and becoming proficient at it offloads effort, freeing up resources for better things. And yes, many tools have been tuned for a narrow use case, and are just 'perfect' for the job.

# Knowhow Loss

Some tools might worry you.

"If I rely on this tool, I will lose the knowhow and skill required to get the job done without it."

A valid concern. We become dependent on our tools.

An examle that comes to mind is navigation. 

# Learning is Required

Using a tool is a skill in and of itself, we have to _learn_ it.

# GPT

Large Language Models (LLMs) are much like brains.

- Context / focus
- Short term memory
- Knowledge with far from perfect retrieval capabilities
- They're slow, when compared to other software
- Can learn

LLM's primary tool, you might say, is word generation. It is the main mechanism by which they interact with the world.

Word generation on its own, goes a long way, but we get to experience its limits very often.

# Example: '1283645 * 1763520931313 = ?'

A simple math problem. However, simply generating words is obviously not the way to go here. LLMs are not endowed with built-in calculators, they're just neural nets.

Good tools are
reliable, predictable
controllable
tend to be specialized
GPT is much like a brain
it's very shares same characteristics with the human brain
it can learn
unpredictable, stochastic
generative
makes things up
perceptive
I found (and many others) that some practices are useful for better cognitive performance.
