My friend and mentor Emily Bache tells us developers "Use your tools!".

GPT use your tools
"Use your tools!" - Emily Bache
I had the pleasure of working with Emily and she has this wonderful saying for us devs: "use it whenever there is a missed opportunity with a gentle reminder..."
Using tools my Dad always used to say "with the right tool, the job is easy"
From the second image:

Good tools are
reliable, predictable
controllable
tend to be specialized
GPT is much like a brain
it's very shares same characteristics with the human brain
it can learn
unpredictable, stochastic
generative
makes things up
perceptive
I found (and many others) that some practices are useful for better cognitive performance.
